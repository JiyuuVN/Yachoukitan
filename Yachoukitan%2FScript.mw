^Like a study. @
^A bookshelf that covers an entire wall, lined up with an antique book collection. @
^The unique odor of leather blended with paper. @
^A curtain-covered window that hides the distinction of day and night. @
^In the center of the carpet stands one velvet couch. @
^There is a form of a child in black. @
^Black suit. White shirt. A fragile frame. Androgynous.@ Wearing slender black glasses. @
^Stretched out on the couch, reading a book with a posture that suggests sleep. @
^The sound of a turning page shakes the atmosphere.@
br
^"One, come here." @
br
^As if in answer, a single butterfly appears.@ Looping down in a spiral, the butterfly settles on the child's shoulder and closes its wings. \
br
^"What happened to its feed?" @
br
^A bored voice rings out. @
^Almost as if in conversation, the jet-black insect hovers close to the child's ear, flapping its wings as though whispering. @
br
^"I see. Got it." @
br
^Listening to the butterfly, the child nods without a change of expression. @
^With a crack, the book is snapped shut. @
br
^———How tedious.@
br
^Impressions are expressed through one simple statement, but there is no reply. @
^The books lined up against the wall reek of death. \

^———I remember.@
^There are many cases in which albinos have imperfect vision if they lack pupil pigmentation. @
br
^"Is it because you can't see very well?"@

^Once asked, she nods her head. It is the behavior of a young child. @
br
^"I'm sorry. What I just handed to you is candy. If you would like to eat it... um, it will make me happy."\

^Unfortunately, I don't have another piece of candy.@

^And my workplace must be this room. \
