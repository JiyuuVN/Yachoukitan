^I finish last night's tale, and Yoru nods expressionlessly.@
br
^"———I see. That birthmark is proof of the (contract)."@
^"...Contract?"@
^"The contract for the ChouTsuki; so to speak, it is the same thing as marriage.@ Proof of mutual love and children begotten together."@
^"Chou and I... children? No, but—"@
^"I understand. Could you show me the birthmark?"@
^"...Yes, I don't mind."@
br
^Draining the rest of his coffee, Yoru rises.@
^Little by little, he closes the gap between us.@
^Abruptly stretching out his hand, he pulls on my shirt collar.@

^————His lips press against mine.\
br
^From between his parted teeth pours a lukewarm fluid.@
bgm"m\entoro.mp3"
^The bitter taste of coffee and———a pill.@
^Before I can react, I hear the echoing sound of the liquid being swallowed.@
br
^"...What did... you make me dri—"@
br
^As I ask in a hoarse voice, my field of vision wavers.@
^In my rapidly receeding consciousness, I hear an indifferent voice inform me.@
br
^"Let me tell you what the solution is.@ There is only one way to erase that birthmark.@ That is by killing the ChouTsuki who holds the contract."@
br
^He catches my body as my knees give way.@
br
^"Good night, Sera-san. Soon you will forget everything."\

^One day, I wake up with no memory.@
^The past of the person called (me) has been broken away, like film on the cutting room floor.@
br

br
^But that is the only thing I remember.@
^Why am I in (this place), I wonder?@

^Raising my eyes, I see a wide stucco ceiling.@
^This room given to me is cozily furnished.@?
^It's been two months since I started living here.@
^Before I know it, the rain turns to sleet, and then to opaque snow.@
^I can't tell if the winter sky is night or day.@
^Little by little, it becomes grey, and before I know it, it's night.@
^Grey and black. Only those two colors exist.\

^————I realize I am searching for white.@
br
^I stop by the window again and look down at the scenery below.@
^Drawn on the bare branches is a straight shadow.@
^Bit by bit, the cold tree shakes.@
^The clouds in the gray sky hang down to touch the tips of the branches.@
^Straining my ears, I hear the sound of footsteps on snow.@

^If I drop my gaze, I see the nameless graves of the deceased.@
^Unconsciously, I search for a new gravestone.@
^————The one as white as the snow.@
^Whenever I try to listen, I can almost hear the sound of dirt being heaped on the buried coffin.@
^I have a feeling that something important is buried.@
^I suddenly see the form of a black-clad child.@
br
^————Mutsuki Yoru. That is his name.\
br
^A pale, pretty boy.@
^He looks unnaturally calm—not like a child at all.@
^For two months, I've heard no voice but his.@
^Exchanging greetings with the commuting housekeeper... no more than that.@
br
^————While he is here, I'm not lonely.@
br
^But it feels as though there are cracks in my heart.@
^Deep within my body, at the very center, it is cold.@
^At length, white crystals begin to fall from the achromatic sky.@
^Pouring into the peaceful graveyard, an afterimage of pure white snow.@
^The snowflakes fall on the windowpane, and I gaze at them as they melt.@
^The black-clad child lingers below the metallic sky.@
br
^————I wonder if he is cold.\

^Suddenly, the (child) looks up at the sky.@
^As he raises his eyes, a single snowflake kisses his cheek.@
^Rising above the grove of trees, a bare sky.@
^Snow falls from the dark ashen clouds, dancing as it slowly flutters down.@
^I exhale, and my breath makes white wings before my face.@

^————Just like a butterfly.@
bg"e\haka2.jpg",12
^I look down at the gravestones, none of which bear any names.@
^The lines for birth and death dates are nowhere to be found either—they're just markers.@
^The snow, falling from the sky, begins to pile up, white upon white.@
^The air is so cold it's hard to breathe.@
^This grave was created————two months ago.@
^Eventually, everything might have grown boring.@
^@
^If I had thought a little about myself that time, I would have decided to kill Chou and make her my own.\
br
^That's why we're together now.@
br
^"You're probably bored down there, right, Chou?"@
br
^The instant I speak, my monologue freezes and crystalizes.@
bg"e\kumo.jpg",12
^The words disappear somewhere, carried on the wind.@
^The sky above looks like it's in the middle of a long sleep.@
^————The dead cannot answer.@
^————However.@
^The Sera of lately stands by the window, gazing at the many things outside.\
